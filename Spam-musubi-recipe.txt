Spam Musubi Recipe

Picture of ingredients
What you will need...

3 cups cooked white sticky rice
1 package of nori(seaweed) sheets (7.5" x 8")
1 can of spam (doesn't matter what kind you choose)
1 bottle furikake (japanese rice seasoning)
1 egg (to be scrambled)

Teriyaki Sauce:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup sugar
1 tbsp mirin

You can find all of these ingredients at the nearest grocery store in the Asian section or go to your local Asian Market. I'd prefer the latter because you are guaranteed to find everything.
